Alright, I know. Another way to perform automation tasks. But it never hurts to have more options, right? :)

**What's included?**

- [CSSLint](https://npmjs.org/package/csslint)
- [JSHint](https://npmjs.org/package/jshint)
- [Uglify](https://npmjs.org/package/uglify-js)
- [Stylus](https://npmjs.org/package/stylus)

**What you can do with Just:**

- Compile and generate CSS files
- Compress and Minify JavaScript files
- Lint JavaScript and CSS files

> This is a work in progress and I will likely add more functionality in the future. Tested on Linux and OSX. =]
