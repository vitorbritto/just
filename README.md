Alright, I know. Another way to perform automation tasks. But it never hurts to have more options, right? :)

**Features**

This build script is capable of processing and minifying Stylus files and compressing and minifying JavaScript files.

**What's included?**

- [JSHint](https://npmjs.org/package/jshint)
- [Uglify](https://npmjs.org/package/uglify-js)

> This is a work in progress and I will likely add more functionality in the future.
